# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is the custom name of data that you will referenece in a function, it doesnt matter what you call it, the function will still work as it's only a placeholder name. However it's best to call it something meaningful and accurate, for looking back on your own code, or for when others read it. An argument is the actual data you put into the function 

Researched answer: A variable that lives within the function definition, it is the name for data that will go through that function. An argument is data that will be passed into the function and will be called on.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: It can only be used on an array, it iterates through and gives you an array the same size as the one you put in. I'm unsure of the optional parameter. (That'
s everything I know about .map)

Researched answer: I can't find much about. map predefined parameters. I found that .map does not require a parameter in the function and can use an anon function. 

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: They are both to be used on arrays, however .map will return an array of the same lenth. .filter will return an array of a different length.

Researched answer: .map will make a new array by changing the individual element. .filter will make a new array removing all the elements that don't meet the conditions set in the HOF.

1. What is iteration? 

Your answer: going through one character at a time in a data piece until it meets the set conditions.

Researched answer: it's a sequence of instructions repeatedly sivving through one element or character at a time until a certain condition is met. Then it's job is completed.

1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: methods only work with objects? 

Researched answer: They are basically the same, other than methods are a procedure for object orientated programming, they are linked with an object. Methods operate data in a class, the class needs to be declared.
While functions are reusable code that can be called anywhere in your programming, they don't need to declare a class, you just call a function by it's name and is independant.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: I don't know...

Researched answer: Javascript has a default behaviour, it moves all declerations to the top of it's scope. Since it's at the top, Javascript knows the variable is there and is aware of it. But it has to be declared in order to be used.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Component: a component is sort of like a function in javascript, they are both independent bits of code that are reusable. However components work in isolation and return html, there are class components and function components. 

2. Spread operator: a Spread operator (syntax ...) will copy all of, or part of an array, or even an object. It can then be put into another array or object. Really helps shorten and neaten up code.

3. React state: A State is an Object, the object holds data related to a react component, which can then be used to store, manage and output data within the app. This allows for dynamic changes to UI.

4. React props: props are like functions in Javascript or attributes in HTML. They are arguments passed into React components and passed via html attributes. They also use the same syntax as html attrimbutes < example class="example2" />

5. DOM events: Signals that something is occuring, has occured. They're triggered by the browser or user interactions. It's things like a web page being loaded, a mouse click, an image finished loading, a mouse hovering over an element, when a form is submitted, when a key pres happens.
